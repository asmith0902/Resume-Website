        <p>Hello,&ensp;my name is Avery Smith and I am pursing my BS in Computer Science 
            at Wofford College in Spartanburg, &ensp;South Carolina. &ensp;I am originally from 
            Atlanta, &ensp;Georgia and I have traveled all of from all different unique 
            (non-computer science related) work opportunities. &ensp;When I began collegeâ€¦&ensp;I 
            began a new journey and so far I have developed a new passion for 
            programming. &ensp;I hope to eventually pursue a career in software engineering 
            or cyber security engineering. &ensp;I am always open to a challenge and the 
            learning endeavors that come with it. &ensp;I have gained many skills so far 
            through my college experience and picked up strong time management, &ensp;
            communication, &ensp;and team work skills through my time as a professional model 
            and small jobs I had growing up. &ensp;This past summer, &ensp;summer 2021, &ensp;I worked an 
            internship with Arbor, &ensp;a company with the mission to help fight climate 
            change. &ensp;During this experience, &ensp;I learned a lot. &ensp;Although I was on the game 
            design team and not the development team, &ensp;it only continued to reinforce	
            my desire to go into software development and taught valuable management 
            and design/prototyping skills. &ensp;Anyways,&ensp;enough about me, lol. &ensp;If you have 
            come to my website today and would like to support my growth of knowledge 
            and experience in my journey, &ensp;then please feel free send me an email to the email below! &ensp;Have a wonderful week&ensp;:) </p>
