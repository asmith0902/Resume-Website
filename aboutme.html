    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Hello,&nbsp;my name is Avery Smith and I am pursing my BS in Computer Science 
            at Wofford College in Spartanburg, &nbsp;South Carolina. &ensp;I am originally from 
            Atlanta, &nbsp;Georgia and I have traveled all over for different unique 
            (non-computer science related) work opportunities. &ensp;When I began collegeâ€¦&nbsp;I 
            began a new journey in which I have developed a passion for 
            programming. &ensp;I hope to eventually pursue a career in software engineering, &nbsp;cyber security engineering &nbsp;or web development. &ensp;I am always open to a challenge and the 
            learning obstacles that come with it. &ensp;Over time I have picked up strong time management,&nbsp;
            communication, &nbsp;and team work skills through my experience as a professional model 
            and small jobs I had growing up. &ensp;This past summer, &nbsp;summer 2021, &nbsp;I worked an 
            internship with Arbor, &nbsp;a company with the mission to help fight climate 
            change. &ensp;During this experience, &nbsp;I learned a lot. &ensp;Although I was on the game 
            design team and not the development team, &nbsp;it only continued to reinforce	
            my desire to go into software development and taught me valuable management, leadership, &nbsp;
            and design/prototyping skills. &ensp;If you have 
            come to my website today and would like to support my growth of knowledge 
            and experience in my journey, &nbsp;then please feel free send me an email to the email below! &ensp;Have a wonderful week&nbsp;:) </p>
